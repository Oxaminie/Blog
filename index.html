        <p>Hello! I am on a (hopefully) career and life changing journey of learning to code.
            I am currently a Modelmaker, but have realised that I want to do more intellectually challenging work - but that still engages my creativity.
            And that is why I have decided to teach myself coding. This blog should enable me to both practise coding, and track my progress. Good luck to me! :)
